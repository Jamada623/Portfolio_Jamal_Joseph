Gunrunner

Requires a controller to play

Is plug and play however

How to play:
The objective of the game is to reach the end of the level and touch the flag.
you move with the left analog stick and shoot with the right analog stick.
you have 3 bullet types:
the rifle- it does pierce damage 
shot gun- short distance but does big damage
assault rifle- rapid fire damage good for clearing multiple enemies fast

Notes:
There is an options menu but the volume slider doesnt work atm

There are still some collision issues but most have been ironed out
