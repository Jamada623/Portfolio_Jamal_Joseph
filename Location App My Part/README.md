# Location App

This is my contribution of code to a 10 man team project.

We created an app where the user could add friends and display both their and the user's current location on a google map.

My section of code dealt with having the user and their friends display on the map as accurately as possible.
It would start and stop tracking the user's location when the app opened and closed respectively.
